#Demure's Dotfiles
This is a repo of my dot files, to help me keep them organized,  
and in-sync between computers and servers.

I am in the [long] process of revamping all of my files, adding useful plugins,  
organizing snippets, improving comments, and trying making one conf work for  
all my systems (when/where possible).

**NOTE:** While I am currently continuing to maintain the github repo,  
I have moved to gitorious. Repo link in top comments, of most comment-able confs.

######Improved:
I think my vimrc has improved a good deal ^__^  
* It will now auto install Vundle if missing, and create undo/backup/swap paths.

My PS1 is much simpl.... Err, neater?  
* The machine test is much more consise, and the git check quite useful.

* Bashrc is now broken up into sub sourced files, much more orginzation potential.

######Plans:
For tmux, I am still debating to use powerline or not...  
One of the annoying issues is that the current beta seems pretty confusing.

<BR>
**PS.** If you happen to have advice, I certainly would be interested in ways to
improve my setup.
