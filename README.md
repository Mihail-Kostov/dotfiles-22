#Demure's Dotfiles
This is a repo of my dot files, to help me keep them organized, and in sync.

I am in the process of revamping all of my files, adding useful plugins,
organizing snippets, commenting, and making one conf work for all my systems.

######Improved:
I think my vimrc has improved a good deal ^__^  
It will now auto install Vundle if missing, and create undo/backup/swap paths.

My PS1 is much simpl.... Err, neater?  
The machine test is much more consise, and the git check quite useful.

Bashrc is now broken up into sub sourced files, much more orginzation potential.

######Plans:
For tmux, I am still debating to use powerline or not...  
One of the annoying issues is that the current beta seems pretty confusing.

<BR>
**PS.** If you happen to have advice, I certainly would be interested in ways to
improve my setup.
